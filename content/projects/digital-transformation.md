## No more terminals

The printing towers are controlled by means of electronic gearing to one of three folder positions. We replaced the 144 register motors with AC servo motors and Allen-Bradley Kinetix 6500 AC servo drives . For visualisation, five Allen-Bradley 17-inch VersaView PCs are used. These run Rockwell software FactoryTalk View. Paper web integrity is monitored by 45 laser sensors. The project included the supply, design, manufacture, documentation, installation and commissioning of the press. The success of this project was covered by Packing & Printing Media magazine.

In phase two mentioned in the article, an additional 16 axis were added for reel unwind and tension control connected in a common DC bus configuration thus providing approximately 48kW of saved energy.
